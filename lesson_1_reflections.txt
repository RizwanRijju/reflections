How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    #It made checking easier by showing changed lines of code in both files and highlighting them with + and - signs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	#It would help in rolling back to the previous versions of your project if you feel that the previous was more stable than the present.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    #Pros of Git -You will only commit after neccesary changes are made.
     Cons of Git - You may forget to commit a change made .

    #Pros of Google Docs - It may be useful at times when you forget to commit any important changes made.
     Cons of Google Docs - As it makes automatic commits, most of them might be made after very little changes have been made and this consumes a lot of memory.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Pretty much simple, it was their way of thinking to solve a problem.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git Log would help in showing all the commits made till date and Git diff would help in seeing the difference between two commits using the commit ID.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	IT would help us to revert back to any of the previously saved versions and also get back to the present version.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Currently iam learning Android Studio. I would add everything I do there.
